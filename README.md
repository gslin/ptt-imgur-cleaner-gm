# [deprecated] ptt-imgur-cleaner-gm

A Greasemonkey script to cleanup Ptt's Imgur thumb, replace the smaller images to the larger ones.

## Deprecated

Since Imgur has blocked Ptt, we need to use a very different approach to overcome it, please use https://github.com/gslin/imgur-links-rewriting-on-ptt instead.

## Install
